## Geograffiti

# What Is This Thing?
This is a mobile image sharing app that allows users to draw virtual images on landmarks in their neighborhoods and see the images left behind by others.

# Why is it Special?
Images naturally decay over time at a fixed pace. Users can increase the longevity of other people's images by adding a thumbs up/upvote type approval marker, allowing communities to create art together.

# How Do I Use It?
Hopefully, point the camera, push a button to approve, draw on your screen to draw.

# Who Made It?
Mars Getsoian, Marielle Ibarreta, Kaitlyn Steagall, Eric Zimmerman.

- Stored image gallery
